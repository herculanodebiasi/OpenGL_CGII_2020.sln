REM =======================================================================
REM Batch (.BAT) script (Windows) to delete all temporary files after
REM  compiling a project with Microsoft Visual Studio (Visual C++) or GCC.
REM 
REM   Warning: It also deletes the debug databases, needed to "step into"
REM    from a debugger. These files may be really *large*, but if you think
REM    you will need them, remove the file for "*.pdb" below.
REM
REM Usage: 
REM  - Open a terminal (Windows-key + R , type "cmd", press ENTER)
REM  - To delete build files from one (or, optionally) more directories, execute: 
REM      delete_build_temps.bat BUILDIR1 [BUILDIR2] [BUILDIR3] [...]
